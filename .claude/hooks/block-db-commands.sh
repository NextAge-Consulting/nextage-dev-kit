# Drizzle/migration guard — default-DENY with an explicit-approval bypass.
# The rule this enforces (postgres-drizzle.md): commands that CHANGE a database
# are never run on Claude's own judgment. When the human has explicitly approved
# a run in the current conversation, Claude prefixes the command with
# SKIP_DB_GUARD=1 and it passes. Same trust model as git-guard's SKIP_GIT_GUARD=1.
#
# db:generate is deliberately NOT guarded. It diffs the schema against
# meta/*_snapshot.json and writes files into the repo; it opens no connection and
# changes no database, and block-drizzle-handroll.sh names it as the ONLY correct
# way to author a migration. Guarding the sanctioned path taught SKIP_DB_GUARD as
# routine muscle memory, which is exactly what must stay exceptional.

# Read input from Claude Code
INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // ""')

# Check if this is a Bash command with database operations
if [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "Bash" ] || [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "mcp__acp__Bash" ]; then
    # Scan the command WITHOUT heredoc bodies. A heredoc body is data being written
    # to a file, never a command being run — so a doc or test fixture that mentions
    # `drizzle-kit` used to trip this guard. A false block is the costly failure
    # here (see the test suite header), and the bypass it teaches is habit-forming.
    # Any failure in the stripper falls back to the raw command: fail closed.
