# /open-pr

Push current branch and create a pull request against main. Part of the gitflow subsystem. Invoked directly (`/open-pr`) or via natural-language triggers ("open pr", "submit for review", "open a pull request").

$ARGUMENTS

## Procedure

### Step 1: Verify branch state

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
```

If working tree is dirty, stop and prompt the user to `/commit` or `/checkpoint` first.

### Step 2: Analyze branch diff

```bash
git diff --stat main..HEAD
git log --oneline main..HEAD
```

If branch is identical to main, stop and report.

### Step 3: Generate PR title

Conventional format: `<emoji> <type>: <description>`. Must match commitlint rules — the CI `commitlint.yml` check will block merge if malformed. Subject <72 chars, imperative mood.

**Do NOT include issue numbers in the title** (no `#123`, no `(#123)`, no `123:` prefix). A PR may name multiple issues; embedding one number is misleading. Issue linkage lives in the `Closes #N` line auto-prepended to the PR body — the record `/deploy` reads to find what shipped. Whether merging closes the issue is the repository's auto-close setting, not this command's.

### Step 4: Generate PR body

Structure:

```markdown
## Summary

<one-paragraph description of what this PR does from a user perspective>

## Changes

- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
- ...

## Testing

<how this was verified — if nothing, say so>

## Signature-change attestations

<see "Attestation format" below — one type-check line, plus one file:line line per compiler-blind seam change>
```

Draw content from the diff and commit log. Do not invent features not in the diff.

### Attestation format

§XIV splits by whether the compiler can SEE the change. Match it:

**1. Type-visible changes** (TS/TSX signatures, exported types/interfaces/enums, a Zod schema used as a TS type) — the compiler IS the caller scan; a stale caller fails `check-types`. Attest the type-check ONCE. Do not enumerate per-symbol counts:

```
Signature changes: type-checked clean — the compiler reconciles every type-visible caller.
```

**2. Compiler-blind seam changes** (DB / Zod / schema FIELD renames referenced by string key, raw-SQL column/table names, string-keyed dispatch, cross-process / RPC / serverFn / webhook payload shapes, cross-language) — the compiler is blind here; a rename compiles green and breaks at runtime. Enumerate the reconciled call sites as `file:line`:

```
Callers scanned: <symbol> → apps/x/foo.ts:42, apps/y/bar.ts:88 (compiler-blind: <reason>).
Callers scanned: <symbol> → 0 callers (compiler-blind; private to apps/x/foo.ts).
```

Rules: `<symbol>` bare (no backticks); every listed `file:line` MUST be a site you actually opened and reconciled — the list is auditable against the diff, so do not pad it; `<reason>` names the seam (e.g. "raw-SQL column rename", "serverFn payload field"). Do **NOT** write `N references across M files` counts — that unfalsifiable count is exactly what the old format rotted into.

**Before composing the section**, grep the diff for the compiler-blind seams only (type-visible changes need no grep — the type-check covers them):

```bash
# DB / Zod / drizzle schema field renames or removals
git diff main..HEAD -- '**/schema*.ts' '**/schema/*.ts' '*/schemas/*.ts' \
  | grep -E '^[-][[:space:]]+[A-Za-z_]+:\s+(z\.|jsonb\(|text\(|integer\(|boolean\(|timestamp\(|uuid\(|varchar\()'
# raw-SQL identifiers + string-keyed dispatch removed/changed in the diff
git diff main..HEAD -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' | grep -E '^[-].*(sql`|queryKey|"type":|action:)'
```

If either surfaces a renamed/removed identifier, grep it repo-wide (INCLUDING `.sql` / `.py` / config / other apps), reconcile each caller, and add its `file:line` line. If neither surfaces anything, the type-check line alone is the complete attestation — a compiler-blind enumeration is required ONLY when a seam actually changed.

Constitution §XIV is the rule; this section is its enforcement surface.

### Step 5: Confirm every linked issue is code complete

Opening the PR moves every linked issue to Staged, so it is a gate. List the ones not yet
marked complete:

```bash
bash -c 'source .claude/skills/gitflow/scripts/issue_helpers.sh && read_branch_incomplete_issues'
```

Empty → pass nothing. Otherwise ask in prose and wait: "Opening this PR marks #42 as Staged
(code complete). Proceed?" Yes → pass `--complete "42"`. **No → stop; no PR is opened.** The
work continues, and a later `/commit` marks the issue when it is done. Without the flag the
script refuses anyway (exit 12), before anything is pushed.

Every linked issue reaches Staged when the PR opens, so every one of them is in scope for
the comment below — pass the whole linked list.

**Then write the Staged comment for each of them that has not had one** — the issue's
author reviews against it. List the ones still needing it:

```bash
bash -c 'source .claude/skills/gitflow/scripts/issue_helpers.sh && issues_needing_notes "<N N>"'
```

Read `.claude/skills/gitflow/references/staged-comment.md` and the issue itself
(`gh issue view <N>`), then write one file per issue, `<notes_dir>/<N>.md`, in a scratch
directory outside the repo (`mktemp -d`). Pass it as `--notes <notes_dir>`. Write it and
move on — never put the wording to the human for approval. The script refuses before
committing (exit 2) when one is missing, and posts each once the board has moved.

### Step 6: Invoke the script

`/open-pr` does NOT touch `changelog.md`. The changelog is owned exclusively by `/deploy`, which composes the consolidated release entry from commit subjects since the last tag at version-bump time. Earlier versions of this command wrote a per-PR entry here too, which produced duplicate bullets in main's changelog after `/deploy` ran (one from the feature-branch insertion, one from the release-branch insertion). Single-writer fixes the duplication structurally — there is no flag to opt back into per-PR changelog inserts.

```bash
.claude/skills/gitflow/scripts/open-pr.sh \
  --title "<conventional title>" \
  --body "<PR body markdown>" \
  [--complete "<N,N>"] [--notes <notes_dir>]
```

Optional: `--draft` to open as draft PR, `--base <branch>` if targeting something other than main.

### Step 7: Wait for PR readiness

`open-pr.sh` has already posted an explicit `/gemini review` comment on the PR (Gemini's auto-review on PR open is disabled in `.gemini/config.yaml: pull_request_opened.code_review: false`; reviews are comment-driven). If the post failed, the script exited 9 — surface the failure; do not proceed to wait.

Invoke the readiness wait — blocks until CI required checks pass AND (unless `GEMINI_NOT_INSTALLED="true"` in `.claude/sync-substitutions.json`) Gemini has posted a review against the current HEAD. The wait reads the trigger-comment history to decide whether a Gemini review is expected; for `/open-pr` it always is, because the script just posted the trigger.

```bash
.claude/skills/gitflow/scripts/wait-for-pr-ready.sh
```

Status updates print every poll cycle (~30s). The user is sitting at the keyboard during this — that's the point of the wait, no other infra needed.

Exit handling:
- `0` → PR is ready. Continue to Step 8.
- `2` → CI failed. Surface the failing check name and PR URL; stop. The user fixes locally and pushes; the failing CI gate is the signal to act.
- `3` → timeout (default 15min). Surface the diagnostic message the script printed (likely Gemini queued/rate-limited, or CI legitimately slow). The user decides: re-invoke with `--timeout-min <larger>`, or — only if Gemini is genuinely absent — set `GEMINI_NOT_INSTALLED="true"` in `.claude/sync-substitutions.json` to opt out.
- `5` → user pressed Ctrl-C. Stop cleanly, no further steps.

### Step 8: Hand off based on Gemini findings count

The wait script's ready message includes a `findings=N` count whenever Gemini posted a review. Surface that count to the user and tailor the handoff prompt to it:

| Wait output | Prompt |
|---|---|
| `Gemini=skipped` (GEMINI_NOT_INSTALLED=true) | `PR #<N> ready. /merge when you're set.` |
| `Gemini=no-trigger-for-HEAD` (post failed silently or repo opted out) | `PR #<N> ready (CI only). /merge when you're set.` |
| `Gemini=posted, findings=0` | `PR #<N> ready. Gemini reviewed clean — /merge when you're set.` |
| `Gemini=posted, findings=N` (N > 0) | `PR #<N> ready. Gemini raised <N> finding(s) — run /triage to walk them, or /merge to ship without triage.` |

Do NOT auto-invoke `/triage` and do NOT auto-invoke `/merge`. The user decides per finding count. The explicit handoff prevents the "trapped in a flow" feeling and lets them abandon cleanly.

If the user runs `/triage` and lands a fix commit via `/commit --review`, that push posts a fresh `/gemini review` comment which arms a new review cycle. The next `/merge` will re-run `wait-for-pr-ready.sh` (called from `merge.sh`) and gate on the new cycle automatically. If the fix commit went out via `/commit --no-review`, no trigger is posted and `/merge` proceeds on CI alone.

### Step 9: Report

- PR created: surface the PR URL
- Script failure modes (Step 6 — open-pr.sh):
  - No gh CLI and no $GITHUB_TOKEN: user setup issue
  - Branch not pushed / push rejected: git state issue
  - API error: surface GitHub's response
- Wait failure modes (Step 7 — wait-for-pr-ready.sh): see exit handling above

## What happens after

On PR open:
- `ci.yml` runs typecheck + Biome + Semgrep + tests (if installed)
- `commitlint.yml` validates the PR title format (if installed)

`changelog.md` is **not** modified on the feature branch. It receives one consolidated release entry at `/deploy` time, covering every commit since the last `v*.*.*` tag — see handbook §6.5.

Post-merge, **nothing fires automatically**. To ship to production, run `/deploy` — it bumps version, writes the consolidated changelog entry, tags, pushes, and dispatches the deploy (CodeBuild projects by default), which nothing else may start — see handbook §11.4.

## Blocking conditions

- Working tree dirty: commit or checkpoint first
- Current branch is `main`: cannot open a PR against itself
- No remote configured: add `origin` remote
- Neither `gh` nor `$GITHUB_TOKEN` available: auth setup needed
- A linked issue is not code complete and was not confirmed: exit 12, nothing pushed
- The PR opened but the board update failed: exit 11 — set the status on the board once the cause is fixed
- A linked issue has no Staged comment in `--notes`: exit 2, nothing pushed
- The PR opened and the board updated but a Staged comment did not post: exit 13 — the script prints the exact `gh issue comment` to run
