# gitflow open-pr: push current branch, create a PR.
# Usage: open-pr.sh --title "<PR title>" --body "<PR body>" \
#                   [--base main] [--draft] [--complete "<N[,N…]>"]
#
# Code-complete gate: every issue linked on the branch must be code complete
# before a PR opens, because opening one sets them all to Staged. An issue not
# yet marked (by /commit) must be named in --complete — the slash command asks
# "this will mark #N as Staged" first, and a no means no PR. Anything left
# unconfirmed exits 12 before the push.
#
# Changelog: NOT touched here. Single-writer model — `/deploy` is the sole
# author of changelog.md (deploy.sh inserts the consolidated release entry
# under today's date header at version-bump time). open-pr previously also
# wrote a per-PR entry; that produced duplicate bullets in main's changelog
# (one from open-pr's feature-branch commit + one from deploy's release-
# branch commit). The duplicate was structural: both scripts read the same
# --changelog-file content, both wrote under the same date header, neither
# deduped. Removed entirely rather than patched.
#
# Transport detection (for PR creation):
#   - If `gh` is available (local), uses gh pr create
#   - Else (cloud containers), uses GitHub REST API via curl + $GITHUB_TOKEN
#
# Cloud Claude sessions receive $GITHUB_TOKEN automatically via the GitHub proxy.
# Local Claude sessions must have `gh auth login` completed, or set $GITHUB_TOKEN manually.
