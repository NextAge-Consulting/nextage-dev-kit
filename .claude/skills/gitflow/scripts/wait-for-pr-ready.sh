# wait-for-pr-ready: poll until PR is ready for triage/merge.
#
# Ready = ALL CI checks pass AND
#         (no /gemini review trigger posted for current HEAD
#          OR Gemini Code Assist has posted a review on current HEAD).
#
# ─── Trigger-aware Gemini gating (2026-05-28) ───────────────────────────
# Gemini Code Assist's auto-review on PR open is disabled in the kit's
# .gemini/config.yaml (pull_request_opened.code_review: false). Reviews
# fire only when a `/gemini review` comment is posted on the PR. The
# gitflow scripts post that comment at the moments where review is
# wanted: /open-pr always; /commit when the user passes --review (or
# accepts the prompt); /deploy never on release PRs (no code).
#
# The wait gate reads that comment history. If a `/gemini review` comment
# exists with `created_at` > HEAD's committer date, a review IS expected
# for this HEAD and we wait for it. If no such comment exists, no review
# is coming and we proceed on CI alone.
#
# This couples trigger and wait via observable state (comment presence)
# rather than per-callsite flags. /deploy doesn't need a --ci-only flag:
# it never posts the trigger on the release PR, the wait reads that, and
# proceeds CI-only automatically. Same for /merge after /commit --no-review.
#
# Comments don't need an author filter — a `/gemini review` comment is a
# `/gemini review` comment regardless of who posted it. Manual triggers
# from the user are treated identically to scripted triggers.
#
# GEMINI_NOT_INSTALLED="true" in .claude/sync-substitutions.json still
# short-circuits the entire Gemini path, for repos where the App is
# genuinely absent. In that mode no trigger should ever be posted (the
# trigger scripts honor the same flag), so the trigger check would
# return "no trigger" anyway — but the explicit short-circuit makes the
# intent clear and avoids one round-trip per poll cycle.
#
# CI gate is intentionally dumb: query every check on the PR (no
# `--required` filter), any FAILURE blocks, any PENDING/IN_PROGRESS
# keeps polling, all SUCCESS or empty list = pass.
#
# Re-reads HEAD + trigger state each cycle so user-pushed mid-wait commits
# retarget the poll.
#
# Usage: wait-for-pr-ready.sh [--pr <number>] [--timeout-min <minutes>] [--poll-sec <seconds>]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  ready
#   2  any CI check FAILED on current HEAD
#   3  timeout
#   4  config / repo state error
#   5  user interrupted
