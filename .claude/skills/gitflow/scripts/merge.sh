# gitflow merge: squash-merge current branch's PR after CI passes, then land on main.
# Usage: merge.sh [--pr <number>] [--base main] [--force-unchecked]
#
# If --pr is not provided, the script uses the PR associated with the current branch.
# If multiple open PRs exist for the current branch, the script lists them and exits —
# caller must re-invoke with --pr <number>.
#
# --force-unchecked bypasses the CI-passed gate AND the production build gate. Use only
# for emergency hotfixes with explicit user authorization.
#
# Production build gate (exit 15): `npm run build --workspaces --if-present` runs LOCALLY
# before the squash. CI does not build — it type-checks, lints and tests — so a build-only
# break (bundler, Tailwind, an import alias a package's own tsconfig does not map) is
# invisible to every earlier gate. This is the last moment the PR is still OPEN, which is
# the whole point: a failure here is fixed on the branch that caused it, in the PR that is
# already under review. Catching it at /deploy instead means the branch is gone and the
# only possible remedy is a second PR to repair the first.
#
# It is NOT in CI on purpose: CI fires on every push, so building there would tax every
# commit, every /open-pr and every triage fix with a full build. Once per merge is the
# right frequency.
#
# Post-merge cleanup:
#   - Switch this checkout to the base branch and fast-forward it to the merged tip.
#   - Delete the now-merged local branch (the remote one is deleted server-side).
#   - Reinstall dependencies if landing on the new base changed a manifest.
#
# The body of work ends here. The next `/work` starts a fresh branch off the
# base you are now standing on.

# failed, so the script aborts BEFORE the base-branch sync + npm ci below,
# stranding this checkout on the merged feature branch after a merge that
# actually landed. Splitting them keeps the squash-merge fatal and the delete
# best-effort, so the checkout always ends up on a current base once the
# merge is in.
#
# Both gh calls run from /tmp with `-R <owner>/<repo>`: with no local repo
# context gh performs only the server-side operation and never attempts a
# local `git branch -D`. That local delete would fail anyway — we are standing
# ON the branch being merged — and its failure would abort the script before
# the base-branch sync below. The local cleanup happens further down, in order,
# once this checkout is back on the base branch.

# PR was open. Either way node_modules no longer matches the lockfile on disk,
# which bites /deploy's `npm run build` gate and every later test run.
# Best-effort: a failed install is surfaced, never aborts the completed merge.
#
# `npm ci`, NEVER bare `npm install` (rules/dependencies.md §I). This is the
# last thing to touch the lockfile before /deploy's build gate. Bare
# `npm install` is free to REWRITE package-lock.json — and does, whenever the
# local npm resolves optional/peer deps differently from the npm that wrote it.
# The corrupted lockfile then sits as an uncommitted change on the base branch,
# which /deploy blocks on (dirty tree) or bakes into the release. `npm ci`
# installs strictly from the committed lockfile and never edits it.
