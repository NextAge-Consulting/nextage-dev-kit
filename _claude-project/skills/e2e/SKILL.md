# /e2e — Claude-as-intelligent-tester

## What this is

The E2E testing model for this shop is locked (kit `PIPELINE.md` §1.5). **No Playwright. No Stagehand. No scripted test suite.** Claude drives `agent-browser` through plain-English flow files; failure is detected behaviorally. This skill is the entry point.

## Invocation modes

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Forced all-flows | user types `/e2e all` | Run every discovered flow regardless of diff. No scope question. |
| Single-flow | user types `/e2e <flow-name>` | Run only the flow whose `name:` frontmatter matches. No scope question, no diff check. |
| Scope question | user types `/e2e` (no arg) | Ask the shared scope question (below) and run whatever the user picks. |

This skill is invoked by the user. It is **not** an auto-firing gate — it runs only when the user asks for it.

## The scope question

When invoked with no flow-name arg, ask **one** `AskUserQuestion`: **"Which E2E flows?"**

| Option | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Diff-scoped** (default) | Run every flow whose `triggers:` match the current diff. This is where the diff logic fires. If the diff matches zero flows: report "no E2E coverage needed for this diff" and exit 0. |
| **All flows** | Run every discovered flow. |
| **Select specific…** | Ask a **second** `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` listing every discovered flow's `name:`. Run exactly the checked flows. |

The diff-scoped path's resolution: `git diff --name-only main..HEAD` (or against the PR base if different), intersect changed files with each flow's `triggers:`. On main / no PR with diff-scoped chosen: treat as all flows.

## Flow file discovery

Priority order (first hit wins):

1. `apps/shared/test/e2e/*.md` — monorepo-with-shared layout
2. `test/e2e/*.md` — flat single-package layout

Use `Glob` to list. Each flow file is a markdown doc with YAML frontmatter + human-readable steps.

## Flow file format

`e2e-author` owns the format and the frontmatter spec — read it there rather than
here, so the two can never drift apart. What the runner needs from each file:

- `name` — the slug `/e2e <name>` targets.
- `app` — short label for log and report output.
- `port` — the port the flow expects on `localhost`.
- `requires-auth` — bool; true means load `TEST_<APP>_EMAIL` / `TEST_<APP>_PASSWORD`
  from `.env` before running, and abort loudly if either is missing.
- `triggers` — globs; any match against the changed files puts the flow in scope.

Below the frontmatter: Preconditions, numbered Steps, and Failure indicators, all
in plain English.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine scope

- Invoked with a flow name arg (`/e2e <name>`): jump to step 3 with that single flow.
- Invoked as `/e2e all`: scope = all flows (forced), no question — jump to step 2.
- Otherwise: ask **the scope question** (above). The user's pick yields the in-scope flow set:
  - Diff-scoped → `git diff --name-only main..HEAD` (or against the current PR base if different), intersect with each flow's `triggers:`. Empty set → report "no E2E coverage needed for this diff" and exit 0.
  - All flows → every discovered flow.
  - Select specific → exactly the flows checked in the multiselect follow-up.

### Step 2: Check dev server state

Per `.claude/rules/dev-server.md`:

1. `lsof -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` for every port the in-scope flow set needs.
2. If a port is occupied: that IS the server under test. Proceed.
3. If a port is free: announce intent, start the server (`npm run dev:shop` / `npm run dev:dealer` / project-conventional command), direct output to `logs/server.log` (or `logs/server-<app>.log` for multi-app projects), wait for the server's readiness log line, continue.
4. Never kill a port you didn't start. Leave any server you started running after the flow completes.

### Step 3: Run each flow

For each flow file:

1. `Read` the flow file.
2. Parse frontmatter (`app`, `port`, `requires-auth`, steps).
3. If `requires-auth: true`: grep `.env` for `TEST_<APP>_EMAIL` / `TEST_<APP>_PASSWORD` — abort flow with a loud error if missing (don't silently skip).
4. Open the app and drive it per `rules/integrations/agent-browser.md` and the
   `agent-browser` skill — they own the session naming, the viewport, whether the run
   is headed, and the startup sequence. Do not restate any of that here.
5. Work through the flow's numbered steps in order, re-snapshotting as the skill requires.
6. For each step: report ✅ if expected content visible + interactive, ❌ with a one-line observation if not. **Screenshot every page-changing step** (navigate, submit, modal) with `agent-browser screenshot --full` to `logs/e2e/<flow-name>/NN-<label>.png` — these are the report's evidence (Step 4). **`--full` is not optional on form or list screens**: a viewport shot is the top third of a long page, so the reviewer approves evidence that never contained the thing that broke (`/e2e-author` R10).
7. **Click reported success but nothing changed?** The button is below the fold — Playwright doesn't auto-scroll at 1440×900. Use the scroll-then-click recipe (`/e2e-author` R1). This is the single most common false-failure — try it before recording a ❌.
8. On ❌: STOP this flow, continue to the next flow (don't abort the whole run — the user wants the full picture).

### Step 4: Report — HTML with screenshots

Produce a **self-contained HTML report** so the user can fire off a run, come back later, and review with confidence. The screenshots are the trust anchor — the user sees the actual pixels behind every ✅, not just your word.

**Use the shared generator — do NOT hand-roll the HTML/CSS each run.** The template, theme, and lightbox live in `.claude/lib/gen-report.mjs` (a shared kit tool — the analysis skill uses it too; learned once, not re-derived). You supply only the data: write the run to `logs/e2e/results.json`, then run it:
```bash
node "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/lib/gen-report.mjs . logs/e2e/results.json   # → logs/e2e/report.html
```
The `results.json` shape (title, subtitle, note, extraStats, flows[] with steps + shots) is documented in the script header. `shots` paths are relative to `logs/e2e/`. Then hand `logs/e2e/report.html` to the user with SendUserFile. The generator guarantees everything below — this list is the contract it fulfils, not a manual checklist:

- **One file, fully self-contained.** Inline every screenshot as a base64 `data:` URI — no external links to break when the file is opened later.
- **Screenshots open in a true lightbox.** Click a thumbnail to view full-size; the overlay has a visible **✕ close** (top-right), **‹ ›** prev/next arrows that walk every screenshot in the report (wrap-around), and an **"N / total" counter**; the dark backdrop also closes. Pure CSS `:target` only (no JS — it must render in the side panel), one `<img>` per shot (no data duplication). Wire prev/next by giving each shot a global index and pointing the arrows at the neighbouring shot's id (`#shot{i±1}`, modulo the count).
- **Capture wall-clock runtime.** `date +%s` at each flow's start and end; sum for the suite total. Runtimes set the expectation for future runs — always record them, pass or fail.
- **Top: run summary** — timestamp, scope (which flows ran + why), pass/fail tally ("6 flows: 5 ✅, 1 ❌"), and **total suite runtime** (e.g. "24m 30s").
- **Per flow: a section** — flow name, overall ✅/❌, and **duration** (e.g. "4m 12s"), then one row per step: step text, ✅/❌, your one-line observation, and that step's screenshot.
- **Screenshot every page-changing step** (captured in Step 3.6) — enough that the user can eyeball "the cart really had 2 items" behind each pass.
- **Failures stand out** — red row, the observation, and the screenshot at the point of failure.
- Theme-aware, responsive, wide tables scroll inside their own container (never the page body). Plain and scannable — no video, no pixel-diffing, no baselines.

Also emit the compact summary table in your chat reply so the result is legible without opening the file:

```
| Flow | Result | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| shop-happy-path | ✅ | 4m 12s | |
| shop-cart | ❌ | 1m 03s | Step 3: add-to-cart below fold, click didn't fire |
| dealer-login | ⏭ | — | Skipped — not in triggered scope |
```

**Honest limit:** screenshots make PASS calls *auditable*, not infallible — a false pass is possible if the page looks right but a subtle bug hides. The report exists so the user can catch that on review. That is the trust model; there is no assertion oracle.

A red flow is the signal to stop and fix before you ship. `/e2e` reports pass/fail; it does not block any merge on its own — acting on a failure is your call.

### Step 5: Close the browser

Tear the browser down per `rules/integrations/agent-browser.md` → Teardown, whether the
run passed, failed, or stopped part-way, and chain it so it fires even if a flow throws.
Leave the dev servers running (`dev-server.md`) — only the browser gets closed.

## Failure semantics

You're not writing `expect(...)`. You're being a user. Failures include:
- Blank page (white screen, no content)
- Click does nothing — button missing, JS crashed, route broken
- Navigation 404s unexpectedly
- Form submit errors out visibly
- Content looks mangled (broken layout, missing images, console errors visible)
- agent-browser can't find the element you expected

When a failure surfaces and you want concrete state: `agent-browser eval 'JSON.stringify({visibility: getComputedStyle(document.body).visibility, errors: window.onerror})'`. Only formalize a step into a structured `agent-browser eval` check if a specific failure class KEEPS slipping through — accretion on demand, not preemptively.

## When a flow fails

- Real bug → fix the bug
- Flow-definition drift (UI changed legitimately, flow file is stale) → update the flow file as part of the same PR
- Either way, don't bypass a red flow. Address it before you ship.
