# gitflow commit: full conventional commit with AI-generated message.
# Usage: commit.sh --message "<full conventional message>" [--model "Claude Opus 4.7"] [--skip-typecheck]
#        commit.sh --push-only
#
# Modes:
#   default     — typecheck, stage all, commit, push (the normal /commit flow)
#   --push-only — skip typecheck/stage/commit; push current HEAD via safe_push.
#                 Use when a prior /commit succeeded at commit but failed at push
#                 (e.g. bogus upstream inherited from the start-point, transient
#                 network failure). No-op if HEAD == @{u}.
#
# Responsibilities (default mode):
#   - Auto-create or rename branch as needed (see Branch behavior below)
#   - Run project-type-appropriate typecheck (unless --skip-typecheck)
#   - Stage all changes
#   - Commit with --no-verify (validation is done by this script)
#   - Push to origin via safe_push (sets upstream correctly on first push)
#
# Branch behavior:
#   - On main/master: derive <type>/<slug> from message, create branch, commit on it.
#   - On wip/<timestamp>: rename to <type>/<slug> from message (unless the wip branch
#     has an open PR, in which case commit in place to preserve the PR link).
#   - On any other branch: commit in place.
#
# Not responsibilities:
#   - Changelog: handled by /open-pr (Claude-generated, committed to feature branch pre-push)
#   - Version bump + tag: handled by /deploy (local, human-in-the-loop) — not by any GitHub Action

# Trigger Gemini re-review on the new HEAD ONLY when --review was passed.
# Gemini Code Assist's auto-review on PR open is disabled in the kit's
# .gemini/config.yaml; reviews fire only via explicit `/gemini review`
# comment. The slash-command handler (.claude/commands/commit.md) prompts
# the user when neither --review nor --no-review was passed and a PR is
# open, then re-invokes with the appropriate flag — so by the time this
# script runs, the choice is already made.
#
# Posting via `gh pr comment` lands under the developer's GitHub identity
# (not a `[bot]` user), bypassing Gemini's loop-prevention filter.
#
# Skipped when:
#   - --no-review was passed (or --review wasn't), regardless of repo state
#   - GEMINI_NOT_INSTALLED="true" in .claude/sync-substitutions.json
#   - No open PR for the current branch (nothing to comment on)
#   - `gh` CLI is not on PATH
#
# Fail-loud on post failure: if the user asked for a review and the comment
# didn't land, the downstream wait-for-pr-ready.sh gate will see no trigger
# and proceed CI-only — the user would silently lose Gemini coverage on
# this commit. Surface immediately.
