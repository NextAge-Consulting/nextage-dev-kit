# gitflow ship-main: direct conventional commit straight to main — no branch,
# no PR, no CI. THE CONSCIOUS EXCEPTION for quick infra / emergency work.
#
# Usage: ship-main.sh --message "<conventional message>" [--model "<name>"] [--skip-typecheck]
#                     [--complete "<N[,N…]>" --notes <dir>]
#
# How it differs from /commit: default /commit on main AUTO-CREATES a feature
# branch (the safety for accidental-on-main). /ship-main does the opposite ON
# PURPOSE — it commits on main and pushes directly. You only get here by
# explicitly asking ("ship to main", "infra commit",
# "emergency to main"); it is NEVER inferred from being on main.
#
# Guardrails:
#   - Refuses unless on main/master (a body of work in progress is on its own
#     branch, so it can't trip this by accident).
#   - Runs the same typecheck + biome lint as /commit (the assist worth keeping);
#     --skip-typecheck for a true emergency.
#   - Commits with a CONVENTIONAL message so the next /deploy classifies it for
#     bump-level + changelog exactly like a merged-PR squash commit.
#   - Pushes straight to main; rebases the commit onto origin/main if it advanced.
#
# Requires main to NOT require a PR — the default; the pipeline uses no branch
# protection (see pipeline.md §1.1). A direct push to main triggers NO workflows
# (CI is pull_request-only; deploys are workflow_dispatch-only), so it lands
# silently and instantly. CI is intentionally skipped — this is the exception
# path; the local typecheck above is the safety net.
