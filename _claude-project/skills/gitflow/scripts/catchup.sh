# gitflow catchup: refresh local code from origin. Two execution paths
# depending on which branch is checked out at invocation time:
#
#   1. On main/master (no current/ in flight, OR user just wants latest code
#      for review) — fetches origin/<base> and fast-forwards local main.
#      Refuses if local main has diverged (has local-only commits).
#
#   2. On a feature branch — merges
#      origin/<base> INTO the feature branch via --no-ff so the integration
#      is a visible merge commit.
#
# Usage: catchup.sh [--base main]
#        catchup.sh --continue        # after manual conflict resolution (feature-branch path only)
#        catchup.sh --abort           # abort an in-progress merge (feature-branch path only)
#
# Why this exists. Two related failure modes:
#   - Feature branch falls behind main while in flight. The eventual /merge
#     may hit a 3-way conflict GitHub can't auto-resolve (e.g. both branches
#     inserted entries under the same changelog anchor — observed 2026-05-12
#     on PRs #147/#148). Code touched by the upstream change diverges from
#     the branch's assumptions, surfacing as runtime breakage post-merge.
#   - Local main goes stale between sessions. a dev starts /work two days
#     after another dev's merges + deploys; without an explicit refresh, /work
#     creates the new current/ off a stale view of main. Today the create
#     path silently fetches; this primitive makes the refresh explicit and
#     fail-loud.
#
# Before this primitive existed, the only paths were (a) `git merge origin/main`
# (forbidden direct git per .claude/rules/git.md), (b) `git rebase origin/main`
# (same), or (c) close the PR and re-open from a fresh branch off updated
# main. (c) was the tonight-of-2026-05-12 workaround — works but wastes a PR
# cycle. /catchup is the proper path.
#
# Mode = default — main path (on protected branch):
#   - Delegates to fast_forward_local_main in branch_helpers.sh.
#   - Refuses if dirty (main should never be dirty under gitflow's model).
#   - Refuses if local main has commits not on origin/main (anomalous).
#   - Fast-forwards on a clean ancestry path. Reports old → new SHA.
#
# Mode = default — feature path (on non-protected branch):
#   - Refuses on detached HEAD.
#   - Refuses if working tree is dirty (uncommitted or untracked files).
#     Rationale: `git merge` into a dirty tree mixes states the user can't
#     easily separate. Either commit/checkpoint first, or stash externally.
#   - Refuses if a merge is already in progress (MERGE_HEAD exists). Caller
#     must --continue or --abort first.
#   - Fetches origin/<base>.
#   - If HEAD already contains origin/<base> (already up-to-date), reports
#     and exits 0 without creating a merge commit.
#   - Otherwise runs `git merge --no-ff origin/<base>` so the integration is
#     a visible merge commit (not a stealth fast-forward). On clean merge:
#     pushes via safe_push and reports.
#   - On conflict: leaves the tree in conflict state, lists the conflicting
#     paths, prints the resolution recipe, and exits non-zero (code 6). The
#     caller (Claude / human) resolves the conflicts in-tree using Edit /
#     editor, then invokes `catchup.sh --continue`.
#
# Mode = --continue (after conflict resolution):
#   - Requires MERGE_HEAD to exist (refuses if there's no merge to continue).
#   - Verifies no conflict markers remain in tracked files via `git diff --check`.
#   - Stages everything, completes the merge commit with git's default
#     merge message (--no-edit), pushes via safe_push.
#
# Mode = --abort:
#   - Requires MERGE_HEAD. Invokes `git merge --abort` to restore the tree
#     to its pre-merge state. Useful when the conflict surface is too large
#     to resolve sanely and the caller prefers re-doing the work in a fresh
#     branch off new main.
#
# Not responsibilities:
#   - No rebase mode. /catchup is merge-based by design: preserves branch
#     history, no force-push needed, plays cleanly with GitHub PR diffs.
#     If you genuinely want a rebase, do it manually (and use SKIP_GIT_GUARD
#     for the `git rebase` call) — that's the rare-case escape hatch, not
#     a primitive.
#   - Does not run typecheck or lint. The merge commit may surface issues
#     that need follow-up commits; those go through /commit normally.
