# dependency-triage — the weekly dependency + vulnerability pass

The repeatable process for clearing dependency PRs and security advisories without re-deciding from scratch each time. Run ~weekly. Claude does the analysis + verification; **the human authorizes every main-landing merge** (merging a Dependabot PR squashes to `main`).

**Read `project-documentation/dependency-policy.md` first.** It holds this project's timelines, who owns the pass, and where an exception is recorded. This skill executes that policy; it does not define it. If the file is missing, say so — the project has not decided its timelines yet.

**Pipeline assumption.** This skill assumes the project is on the **kit pipeline**: gitflow tooling, `/deploy` as the release boundary, and CI that does **not** build the app. A project that broke from that pipeline owns the subtraction — this skill's gating logic won't fit it (and such projects don't run dependabot triage anyway).

## The one fact that drives everything

**PR-CI does not build the app.** `ci.yml` runs `dep-alignment` + `check-types` + `biome` + `vitest` (+ `semgrep`) — never the production build. The only automated build gate is in `/merge`, and **Dependabot PRs never touch it** — they land via `gh pr merge` (step 3–5 below), not through gitflow. So a dep PR reaches `main` with nothing having built it. So:

- **Green Dependabot CI ≠ build-safe** for anything in the bundler/SSR graph.
- A toolchain bump that breaks the build can merge on green CI and **poisons `main`** — every subsequent `/merge` on any branch then fails its build gate on damage it did not cause, until someone fixes it.
- Therefore: **toolchain bumps get a local prod build + app smoke before merge.** Leaf bumps don't.

## Tiers — triage by blast radius, NOT CI color

| Tier | What | Gate before merge |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — CI/infra** | `github-actions`, `docker` (non-Node), `chore(ci)` | Green CI. Cannot touch the app build. |
| **2 — Leaf libs** | runtime/util libs NOT in the bundler/SSR graph | Green CI (rebase first if stale). |
| **3 — Toolchain** | bundler / React / framework / SSR adapter | Green CI **+ local prod build + app smoke**. One PR at a time, never batched. |

**The Tier-3 set is exactly the `npm-toolchain` group in `.github/dependabot.yml`** (kept separate from `npm-patch` for precisely this reason). **Read that group to know what's Tier 3 in THIS project — do not hardcode a package list.** `postcss` and anything else in the CSS/build pipeline is Tier 3 even if it arrives in a leaf group.

## Weekly procedure

1. **List + status.**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --author "app/dependabot" --state open \
     --json number,title,mergeable --jq '.[] | "#\(.number) \(.mergeable) \(.title)"'
   gh pr view <N> --json statusCheckRollup \
     --jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion=="FAILURE") | .name'
   ```
   Old PRs failing on `check-types`/`biome` are almost always **stale base, not a broken dep** — rebase before trusting red.

2. **Baseline.** Confirm `main` builds clean first: `git pull --ff-only origin main` then the project's build command (discover it from `package.json` scripts — typically `npm run build --workspaces --if-present`). If main is already red, fix that before touching deps.

3. **Tier 1 — merge on green.** `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`.

4. **Tier 2 — rebase → merge green.** `gh pr comment <N> --body "@dependabot rebase"`, then merge when green. No build needed.

5. **Tier 3 — apply to CURRENT MAIN, deploy-image verified, human-authorized.** NEVER test the PR's own branch (it's often weeks stale, missing current files; only the version bump matters, applied onto today's main). On clean main: `npm install <pkg>@<ver>` the target versions (regenerates the lockfile = current-main + bump), then **build + run the real deploy Docker image** and verify in a browser. **Discover the exact build/run commands and ports from the project's `Dockerfile.*` + deploy workflows** — do not assume. Verify the **heaviest / most-divergent app** (and any app whose config diverges, separately). Human authorizes commit+push to main; broken → fix or close.

6. **Close superseded.** When a group PR already contains a package that also has a standalone PR, close the standalone with a note once the group lands.

## Advisories — the other half of the pass

Dependabot PRs cover what CAN be fixed by a version bump. Advisories cover what is
KNOWN to be vulnerable. They overlap but are not the same list, and the gap between
them is where the real risk sits.

```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/dependabot/alerts --jq \
  '.[] | select(.state=="open") |
   "\(.security_advisory.severity)\t\(.dependency.package.name)\t\(.security_vulnerability.first_patched_version.identifier // "NO FIX")"'
```

If that call 403s, read the repo's Security tab in a browser instead — the API is
restricted on org-owned private repos, the web UI is not.

For each open advisory, exactly one of:

- **A patched version exists and a Dependabot PR is already open** — it is not a
  separate piece of work. Handle it as the PR, by tier, above. Do not track it twice.
- **A patched version exists but no PR opened** — usually a transitive dependency.
  Bump the DIRECT dependency that pulls it in, not the transitive one; forcing a
  transitive to a version its parent was not built against is how you destabilise an
  app to fix a finding. `npm why <pkg>` shows what pulls it in.
- **No patched version exists** — nobody can fix this, including us. Record an
  exception per the policy: what it is, why it can't be fixed, who approved it, and
  the date it gets reviewed again. Then move on. An advisory with no fix is not a
  failure to remediate; leaving it unrecorded is.

**Security PRs skip the cooldown.** Dependabot delays version updates (3d patch / 7d
minor / 30d major) to sit out the window where a compromised release gets yanked —
but security updates open immediately. So a security PR has had *less* soak than a
routine one, not more. Read what actually changed before merging it; do not treat
"security" as a reason to merge faster.

## Node LTS — part of every pass

`dependabot.yml` blocks Node major bumps because Dependabot cannot tell an LTS major
from a non-LTS one, so nothing else will ever surface the transition. Two commands —
run them every pass rather than making anyone remember a separate cadence:

```bash
curl -s https://nodejs.org/download/release/index.json | \
  jq -r '[.[] | select(.lts != false)][0].version'
grep -h '^FROM node:' Dockerfile.* 2>/dev/null | sed -E 's/^FROM node:([0-9]+).*/\1/' | sort -u
```

Almost every week this matches and there is nothing to do. When it doesn't, that is
planned work — a tracked task, not a merge. Bump the Dockerfile `FROM` and the `node-version:` in
`.github/workflows/*.yml` together, or CI and prod drift apart.

## Verification standard (Tier 3)

"Solid" means **build the real prod image, run it on the app's native port, and complete a real login** — NOT "200 on a route" and NOT "server ready" in the log (crypto/auth often loads lazily per request, so a boot can succeed while every request 500s). Full standard: the kit's **`dependency-management.md §5`**.

## Dependency discipline (read alongside)

- **One version per shared dependency** is CI-gated by `dep-alignment` (`npm run check:deps`). When a shared dep updates, bump it to the same version in every workspace that declares it.
- The deeper discipline — trust-but-verify on old workarounds/pins, solid-version philosophy, accepted-residuals handling — lives in the kit's **`dependency-management.md`**.

## Guardrails

- **Never `/deploy` or `/ship-main` as part of triage** — those are the human's to trigger.
- **Merges land on `main`** — the human authorizes each (or the batch) explicitly.
- **Never merge a Tier-3 PR on green CI alone.** The build gate is the whole point.
- **Never override the Node major ignore rule** in `dependabot.yml`. LTS transitions are handled by the quarterly check above.
- `dependabot.yml` group definitions (the toolchain/leaf split) are kit-standard; cooldown / limits / ignore lists and pattern *extensions* are per-project tunables in its header.
