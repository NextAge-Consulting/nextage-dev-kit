# Neon: Branching and Provisioning

Neon's branches are copy-on-write forks of a database at a point in time. Cheap,
fast, and the reason dev and tests can run against real data instead of fixtures.

## Dev is a branch of production

A dev database is a branch of prod, not a hand-seeded copy. That is what makes it
real enough to trust: the same rows, the same distributions, the same
awkward legacy values.

Which one your `DATABASE_URL` points at is a question with an answer, not a thing
to weigh up: `node scripts/db-branch.mjs` resolves the endpoint through the Neon
API and prints the branch. `DEV` means proceed, `PRODUCTION` means stop and get
approval, `UNKNOWN` means it could not tell — which is never the same as safe.

**A reset from parent wipes everything created on the branch.** Refreshing dev
from prod discards any object, row or grant that exists only on dev.

**So ad-hoc SQL is never how something lands. Anything expressible as a migration
IS a migration** — including a data seed, a collation, an extension, a role
grant, a bookkeeping row. `drizzle-kit generate` writes the migration and its
bookkeeping together, and editing the body of the generated `.sql` is the
supported way to put arbitrary SQL inside it (`postgres-drizzle.md`). A migration
then reaches every branch by the normal path: dev now, prod at deploy, and a
reset cannot destroy it.

Running that same SQL by hand against dev looks identical and is not. The reset
erases it, prod never receives it, and the gap surfaces at deploy — which is
exactly how a seeded lookup table shipped empty.

**The one exception is a fix SQL alone cannot express** — one that needs
scripting, parsing, or per-row judgement. That is a human-gated action, the same
gate as `db:generate` and `db:migrate`: say what you intend to run and get
approval in the conversation before running it. Never on your own judgement.

## Tests fork their own branch

DB-backed tests provision **one ephemeral branch per run**, migrate it, point the
connection string at it before any worker spawns, and delete it in teardown, with
a short `expires_at` as the crash backstop. Each test runs inside a rolled-back
transaction, so parallel tests are MVCC-isolated and production is never written.
Costs about a cent a run.

Because the branch forks production, these tests see **real** data — which makes
them the only place a whole class of defect is reachable at all: a lookup table
drifting from what the field actually reports, a catalog missing a row a live
device depends on. A fixture-based unit test can only ever prove the fixture is
self-consistent.

The discipline around *confirming the suite actually ran* — it drops silently when
the Neon credentials are absent, and the run still exits green — is in the
`testing-verification` rule. Read it before reporting a pass.

## Provisioning a new database

A database created empty and then migrated is **not** equivalent to a branch of
an existing one. Anything that lives at the database level rather than in the
migrations is simply absent.

The one that bites hardest is a nondeterministic collation. `CREATE TABLE …
COLLATE case_insensitive` fails outright with `collation "case_insensitive" does
not exist` — a loud failure, and the good case. The silent one is a schema that
never references the collation: every text column comes out case-sensitive, the
database provisions cleanly, and it behaves differently from every sibling while
running identical code. A user whose stored email differs in case signs in on one
and not the other.

**Create the collation as the first migration, or as a provisioning step before
migrations run.** One statement, visible in the migration history, works with any
provisioning API:

```sql
CREATE COLLATION IF NOT EXISTS case_insensitive (
  provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-ks-level2', deterministic = false
);
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```

Cloning from a template (`CREATE DATABASE <new> TEMPLATE <template>`) also copies
the collation and every column's collation, so databases are born correct. Two
caveats: `CREATE DATABASE` locks out connections to its template while copying, so
the template must be a dedicated migrated-but-empty database that then has to be
kept current — and a hosted provider's create-database API may not expose
`TEMPLATE` at all. Prefer the first unless there is a reason not to.

## Ownership is set at creation, not fixed afterwards

Create the database with the **application's owning role** named explicitly
(`owner_name` in Neon's API). Ownership is a control-plane property that Neon
re-applies on every compute start, so a database created under the provider's
default role and then handed over with `ALTER DATABASE … OWNER TO` does not stay
handed over — the change is reverted underneath you, and migrations fail with
permission errors that look intermittent.

The app and its migrations connect as the same owning role. A separate
least-privilege application role is a legitimate choice, but it is a decision to
make deliberately, not a default to drift into: with migrations and runtime on
different roles, every new object needs its grants sorted out.
