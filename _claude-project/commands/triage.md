# /triage

Walk through open Gemini Code Assist review comments on the current PR, **one at a time**. Part of the gitflow subsystem. Invoked directly (`/triage`) or via natural-language triggers ("triage gemini", "work the review", "go through the review comments").

$ARGUMENTS

## Protocol

One item at a time. Never batch. Never auto-act.

### Step 1: Identify the PR

Resolve the open PR for the current branch:

```bash
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json number,url,title --jq '.[0]'
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number, use that instead. If no PR exists, stop and tell the user.

### Step 1.5: Ensure Gemini has reviewed current HEAD

Gemini reviews are comment-triggered (auto-review on PR open is OFF in `.gemini/config.yaml`). Before triaging, confirm a `/gemini review` was posted for the current HEAD and a review has been returned. Invoke the readiness wait:

```bash
.claude/skills/gitflow/scripts/wait-for-pr-ready.sh --pr <N>
```

The script reads the trigger-comment history. If a `/gemini review` comment exists for the current HEAD and a Gemini review has been posted against it, exits ready. If no trigger exists (e.g. last `/commit` was `--no-review`), it exits ready on CI alone — meaning there's no fresh Gemini review to triage. In that case, surface to the user: `Gemini has no review for the current HEAD — last commit was --no-review. Re-trigger with: gh pr comment <N> --body '/gemini review' and re-run /triage, or skip triage.`

Exit handling:
- `0` → Gemini posted (or skipped — see ready message). Proceed to Step 2 only if `findings=N > 0`.
- `2` → CI failed. Triage is pointless until CI is green. Surface the failure and stop.
- `3` → timeout. Surface the diagnostic; The user decides whether to extend, disable Gemini gating, or proceed manually.
- `5` → user interrupted. Stop cleanly.

If `GEMINI_NOT_INSTALLED="true"` (this repo doesn't have the Gemini App): the script returns immediately on `Gemini=skipped`, so this step is effectively a no-op + CI green check. No special-casing needed in this command.

### Step 2: Pull Gemini comments on current HEAD

Capture the current PR HEAD SHA, then fetch reviews and inline comments filtered to **Gemini's review of HEAD specifically**:

```bash
HEAD=$(gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/reviews" \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"gemini-code-assist[bot]\" and .commit_id == \"$HEAD\")]"
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments" --paginate \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"gemini-code-assist[bot]\" and .original_commit_id == \"$HEAD\")]"
```

**Why two different filter fields**: review objects and inline-comment objects expose different commit-tracking semantics in GitHub's API.

- **Reviews** carry an immutable `commit_id` — the commit the review was submitted against. Filtering on `commit_id == HEAD` correctly selects only the review Gemini submitted against the current HEAD.
- **Inline comments** carry TWO commit fields: `original_commit_id` (immutable — the commit Gemini wrote the comment against) and `commit_id` (mutable — GitHub auto-updates this as the comment is re-anchored to the latest diff where the line still resolves). Filtering inline comments on `commit_id == HEAD` is **wrong**: GitHub keeps surfacing stale comments by auto-bumping their `commit_id` to the current HEAD, even when the underlying concern has been addressed in a subsequent commit. The freshness filter must use `original_commit_id == HEAD` so only comments freshly posted against the current HEAD by Gemini's latest review pass are surfaced. (Observed in real life on PR #143: a "Fixed in upcoming commit" reply was acknowledged, the fix landed in the next commit, and the same comment id resurfaced on the next triage with auto-updated `commit_id` matching the new HEAD even though Gemini had not re-flagged it.)

Gemini reviews are comment-triggered (auto-review on PR open is OFF). `/open-pr` posts the first trigger; `/commit --review` posts one on subsequent pushes. When Gemini re-flags a concern that survived a fix, it posts a NEW comment object with a new id and `original_commit_id == new HEAD` — so the filter still catches genuine re-flags. Stale auto-re-anchored comments with `original_commit_id == old HEAD` are correctly omitted. The wait-for-pr-ready gate already confirmed a review was posted for HEAD before triage runs (or that no trigger exists, in which case there's nothing to triage).

From inline comments: `id`, `node_id`, `body`, `path`, `line`, `commit_id`, `original_commit_id`, `pull_request_review_id`. The `id` is required later to post threaded replies. The `original_commit_id` is the field used for the freshness filter above. From review bodies: the high-level summary that Gemini posts.

Exclude items the user explicitly marked resolved.

Build an ordered list (by file, then line). Gemini severity labels are `Critical | High | Medium | Low | security-critical` (the security-critical tag is composable with other severities).

### Step 3: Present item 1

Format:

```text
Triaging PR #<N> — <M> Gemini items

Item 1 of <M> — <severity emoji> <Gemini severity label>
  Location: <file>:<line>
  Concern: <one-sentence summary of what Gemini is saying>
  Proposed fix (from Gemini): <brief — elide long snippets, link to PR thread>

Recommendation: <fix | skip | discuss> — <one-line reason>
```

**Then WAIT.** Do not proceed until the user responds.

### Step 4: Act on the user's decision

**HARD RULE 1 — NEVER COMMIT MID-TRIAGE.** When the end-of-triage `/commit` is invoked with `--review`, it triggers ONE Gemini re-review. If you commit mid-triage with `--review`, each commit posts a fresh `/gemini review` and you get N reviews for N commits = review flood + wasted quota. Even with `--no-review` mid-triage, fragmenting the fix history across multiple commits muddles the PR's narrative. Batch all fixes into ONE commit at the end of triage (Step 6).

**HARD RULE 2 — DECLINED FINDINGS MUST LAND AN INLINE SOURCE COMMENT.** When the user declines a finding (says "no", "skip", "not applicable", "false positive"), the workflow MUST also stage a one-to-three-line inline comment at the flagged source line stating the carve-out reason. Examples: `// §VI safe: absolute-instant audit timestamp, not user-facing`, `// nginx h2c rule: real fix is the map-based Upgrade allowlist (see top of file)`, `// rate-limit safe: this endpoint is admin-only, gated upstream by auth middleware`. The PR-thread reply alone is INSUFFICIENT — Gemini reviews are stateless across cycles, and PR-thread replies are not visible to the model on the next pass. Without the inline source comment, the next push triggers a fresh Gemini review and the same finding resurfaces verbatim, costing another triage cycle. The inline comment is the durable record; the PR reply is the audit trail. Both are required.

The inline comment lands as part of the single end-of-triage commit (Hard Rule 1). It does NOT trigger a separate commit.

| User says | Action |
|---|---|
| "yes" / "fix" / "do it" | Implement the fix. **Stage the change locally only — DO NOT commit.** Post a one-line threaded reply on the Gemini comment: `Fixed in upcoming commit.` via `gh api --method POST "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies" -f body='Fixed in upcoming commit.'` (uses the `id` captured in Step 2). The reply gives each finding a per-thread acknowledgment in the PR's paper trail. Move on to next item. |
| "no" / "skip" | Ask: "reply to Gemini with a reason, or silent skip?" If reply, draft a 1-2 sentence reply and, after user confirms wording, post a **threaded** reply on the specific Gemini comment via `gh api --method POST "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies" -f body='...'`. Do NOT use `gh pr comment` — that posts at PR level and loses thread context. **THEN: land an inline source comment at the flagged line stating the carve-out reason** (Hard Rule 2 above). If silent, still land the inline source comment — silent-skip without a source-level record will resurface the finding on every push. |
| questions / "discuss" | Answer. Loop back to step 3 until a clear decision. |

### Step 5: Advance

After acting, present item 2 in the same format. Continue until every item is processed.

### Step 6: Summary + single end-of-triage commit

After the last item:

- Items fixed: N (list each finding addressed)
- Items replied-declined: N (links to posted replies)
- Items silent-skipped: N
- Final PR state: link to `gh pr view --web`

If any "fix" decisions were made, prompt the user: "Triage complete. N fixes staged. Ready to commit?" On user authorization, invoke `/commit` ONCE with a message bundling all fixes. The user (via the `/commit` prompt, or by passing `--review` / `--no-review` directly) decides whether the new HEAD triggers a fresh Gemini review. Per the no-auto-commit rule, do not invoke `/commit` without explicit user instruction.

## Constraints

- **One at a time.** Even if the user says "they all look similar," still present each one.
- **Never auto-act.** Every item requires an explicit user decision.
- **NEVER commit mid-triage.** Single end-of-triage commit only — see Step 4 Hard Rule 1. Multiple commits with `--review` would trigger multiple Gemini reviews.
- **DECLINED FINDINGS MUST GET AN INLINE SOURCE COMMENT.** Step 4 Hard Rule 2. PR-thread replies alone don't survive the next Gemini cycle.
- **Gemini only (MVP).** Human reviewer comments and other bots are future scope.
- **Recommendation is a hint, not a filter.** Always present the item, even ones the recommendation would skip — the user decides.

## Blocking conditions

- Current branch has no open PR: run `/open-pr` first
- Branch is `main`: nothing to triage
- `gh` CLI not available: install gh
- Zero open Gemini items: report "no Gemini items to triage" and exit clean
