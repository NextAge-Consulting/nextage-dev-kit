// Cross-workspace dependency alignment gate.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: in a monorepo every workspace is meant to run on ONE shared
// stack. When a dependency is declared at different versions across workspaces
// (e.g. better-auth ^1.5.5 in one app but ^1.6.11 in another) you get "works in
// one app, breaks in another" production failures that are brutal to diagnose.
// Dependabot bumps each manifest independently and has no concept of cross-app
// consistency, so it CREATES this skew rather than catching it. This gate is the
// safety net: it fails the moment any shared dependency drifts to more than one
// version across the workspaces.
//
// Single-package repos (no `workspaces` field) have exactly one manifest, so the
// gate is a guaranteed no-op pass — safe to run unconditionally on any Node repo.
//
// Background + the discipline this enforces: DEPENDENCY-MANAGEMENT.md in the
// dev kit (project-documentation/).
//
// Run: node scripts/check-dep-alignment.mjs   (exit 1 on skew, 0 when aligned)
