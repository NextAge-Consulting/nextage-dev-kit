# npm Install Guard — enforces rule I of `.claude/rules/dependencies.md`.
#
# Blocks a BARE `npm install` / `npm i` (no package named) when a
# package-lock.json already exists. That command is free to REWRITE the
# lockfile, and on a machine with a different npm version it will — silently
# churning the committed lockfile and breaking everyone else's install.
# `npm ci` installs strictly from the lockfile and never rewrites it.
#
# ALLOWED (never blocked):
#   - `npm ci`                       — the disciplined install
#   - `npm install <pkg>` / `-D pkg` — deliberately adding a dependency
#   - bare `npm install` when NO package-lock.json exists — the legitimate
#     first install that CREATES the lockfile (npm ci can't: it needs one)
#
# Detection is pragmatic, not a full shell parser (same stance as the other
# guards): it splits the command on && || ; | and inspects each segment. The
# lockfile is checked in the payload cwd. A chained `cd subdir && npm install`
# is checked against cwd, not subdir — so an odd monorepo bootstrap could slip
# through (errs toward allowing, never toward a false block). Override always
# available.

# Emergency override (user-authorized only): prefix with SKIP_NPM_GUARD=1
