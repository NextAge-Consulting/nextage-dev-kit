# Stops a CONSUMER machine's AI from modifying kit-OWNED files. The set is read

# consumer, no kit repo needed — and it is the `mode` on each entry that
# decides, never the presence of the key: `owned` is guarded, `template` is the
# project's own file and passes through. See the mode table below.
#
# The kit MAINTAINER is exempt: if `~/.claude/kitmaster` exists the hook is
# inert. That marker exists only on the maintainer's machine (one-time
# `touch ~/.claude/kitmaster`), so consumers get teeth and the maintainer edits
# freely.
